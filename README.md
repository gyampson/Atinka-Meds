## ⚙️ How It Works

✔️ User launches the app and sees an interactive menu.  
✔️ User can add or list drugs, suppliers, customers, or transactions.  
✔️ Data is saved to text files in the `/data/` folder.  
✔️ On next run, data is automatically loaded from files.  

---

## 📦 Data Folder

Your `data/` folder must contain these CSV files:

- `drugs.txt`
- `suppliers.txt`
- `customers.txt`
- `transactions.txt`

✅ Each file has a header line. Example:

**drugs.txt**
```

code,name,suppliers,expiry\_date,price,stock

```

**transactions.txt**
```

transactionID,customerID,drugCode,quantity,totalPrice,date
